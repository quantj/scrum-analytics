## Data Challenge
Objective: Capture scrum certificates data in order to measure the market demands for scrum certifications.

Assumptions: If there are less certifications being issued, the demand for scrum is trending downwards and same user group will be getting different certifications 

Next Step: If scrum certifications are not in demand, what other certifications are the same pool of users collectively getting next?
